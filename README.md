# IMDBScraper

## Project Summary

IMDBScraper is a scraping tool that scrapes the IMDB website to fetch data about TVSeries.
This tool is used by the [PlotTv-api](https://github.com/dportela24/plottv-api) to gather data about new TV Series.

## Built with

IMDBScraper is developed using Java + Jsoup.

## Usage

### Making a request

The scraper can be used by simply importing it, creating an instance and feeding it a TV Series name or IMDB ID through the function `scrap`.
This function returns a TVSeries object containing the fetched data.

A simple usage example to fetch data about the TVSeries Game of Thrones can be the following:
```javascript
IMDBScraper scraper = new IMDBScraper();
TVSeries tvSeries = scraper.scrap("Game of Thrones");
```
### The TVSeries object

A TVSeries object is the final result of the scraping process.
As the name says, it represents a tv series and contains all its concerning information, including its seasons and episodes.

The TVSeries object follows the following (partial) structure.
A complete representation of a TVSeries object is available [here](https://github.com/dportela24/IMDBScrapper/blob/main/example_result).
